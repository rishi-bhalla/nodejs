arrow functions do not bind themselves to this value. Infact they can access the context in which they are created. This makes them poor candidates for methods and are good for almost everything else.

in case of synchronous calls inside functions, functions can return values and this returned value will be available to the caller. In case the function contains an asynchronous call, the return value would be always undefined because node processes the callbacks after the callstack is empty. Hence in this case, the return value would be undefined and we use the concept of callbacks in case of asynchronous calls.
